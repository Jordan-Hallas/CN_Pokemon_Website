        <p class="font">The full type chart here displays the strengths and weaknesses of each type. Look down the left hand side for the attacking type, then move across to see how effective it is against each Pokémon type.</p>

        <h1 class="title" font>About Pokemon Types</h1>
        <p class="font">Pokemon can come in 14 different types. They are either a single typing or are able to have any combination of 2 differing types (for instance Normal, Electric or Rock/Ground, Grass/Poison). Pokemon moves also come is the 14 types aswell but these can only be monotype.
            
        Every type has others that they are strong or weak against. An example would be that Water is super effective on Fire but is resisted by Grass. Dual type pokemon will have the damage type calculated against both of its types. An example would be that Fire is super effective on Ice but would be neutral to an Ice/Water type.</p>
        <p class="font">A single-type advantage (for instance a Water attack against a Ground-type Pokémon) will net you double normal damage. The advantages also stack up, so a double-type advantage (for instance a Water attack against a Ground/Rock-type Pokémon) will net you quadruple damage. In both these cases you will see the message It's super effective! in-game after the attack. 
        
        Conversely, a single- and double-type disadvantage will afflict half and a quarter normal damage respectively. Here you will see the message It's not very effective... in-game.</p>
        <p class="font">Another advantage you can gain is Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB). As the name implies, this increases the power of the move if the attacking Pokémon has the same type as the move used (for example a Fire-type Pokémon using a Fire-type move). In this case the damage is 1.5 times normal. Again this is added to any other advantages, so a Water-type Pokémon using a Water-type move against a Ground/Rock-type Pokémon will bag you six times (2×2×1.5) normal damage!</p>
